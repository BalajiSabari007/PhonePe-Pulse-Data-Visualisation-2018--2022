# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualisation-2018--2022

Hi friends this is the app I created to visualize PHONEPE-pulse data analysis which I get Phonepe pulse github.repo then i deployed this app in Streamlit wep page.
Let's enjoy my codes✌️.

 -> First I extracted the data from Phone-pe Pulse git hub repository through cloning.
 
 
 ->Then using for loop in Jupyter converted all the JSONfiles to DataFrame to make it csv files.

 ->In this code,e we can see each step of how I extracted the data using for loop and converted to dataframe.
 
 
 -> Using this above code we can create all required files.
 
 
 ->After extracting the data we need to upload it in MySQL using mysql.connector

 
 ->After connectionn we need to create a  table and insert CSV files into the Mysql database.
 
 
 ->Ater inserting all files into MySQL we need to createa  web app using Streamlit.
